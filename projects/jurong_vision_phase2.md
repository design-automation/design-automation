## Research Overview

The main objective of the proposed research is to directly support JTC’s decision making processes with semi-automated computational methods that improve productivity and transparency. These methods can be applied within different departments within JTC, with the emphasis currently being on Land Resource Management (LRM) and on Urban Planning (UPD). 

In terms of application, the focus is on the 3,000 ha Jurong Industrial Estate (JIE) site. The JIE site belongs to these areas, with a land use mostly characterised by rather old, sometimes out-dated port-related industries, warehouses and storage areas. The transformation of this area into a high-density mixed-used area with clean environment and high attractiveness for people as well as industry requires new planning and design approaches and ground-breaking strategies. 

As the JTC planners are elaborating their Jurong Vision, they urgently need tools that enable iterative generation and evaluation of possible future urban outcomes based on predictive feedback to support decision-making. The proposed research will directly address this issue focusing both on tool development and on the application of tools in support of their planning processes. The research has been split into two phases, each constituting a separate research project. Phase 1, already completed, consisted of a Feasibility Study for the development of a set of methods for improving the productivity and transparency of certain existing decision making processes within JTC. Phase 2 is focusing on developing Proof of Concept decision support tools for applying these methods.
