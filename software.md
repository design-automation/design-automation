Below is a list of the main software projects developed at the Design Automation Lab.

## Möbius Modeller

The Möbius Modeller is a web application that allows users to create automated procedures using visual programming.  These procedures could be applied in a wide variety of domains. Currently, Möbius Modeller is focusing on the architectural and urban design domain, allowing procedures to be developed for generating and evaluating 3D models of buildins and urban neighbourhoods. All procedures are executed in the browser on the client side, and as such no server side process is required.

### 3D Model Kernel

In order to support 3D semantic modelling, we have developed a 3D kernel that allows geometry and semantics to be tightly integrated. Arbitrary data attributes can be attached to  geometric objects, points, and components. These entities can also be grouped into nested hierarchies. The use of attributes and groups allows rich 3D data sets to be created by users, suited and customised to their specific purposes.

### 3D Modelling Library

A library of 3D modelling functions has been developed to allow complex 3D geometries to be generated and manipulated. These functions work with the gs-kernel

### 3D Model Viewer

For viewing models creating using the gs-kernel, a web-based viewer has been created. This viewer converts the models into threejs, so that they can be visualised and manipulated in the web browser.
