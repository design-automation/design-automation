# Overview

Parametric Information Modelling is a novel approach to parametric modelling that tightly integrated geometric and semantic information. 

Arbitrary data attributes can be attached to  geometric objects, points, and topological components. These entities can also be grouped into nested hierarchies. The use of attributes and groups allows rich 3D data sets to be created by users, suited and customised to their specific purposes.

## PIM Kernel

In order to support 3D semantic modelling, we have developed a 3D kernel that allows geometry and semantics to be tightly integrated. 

## PIM Functions

A library of 3D modelling functions has been developed to allow 3D geometries to be generated and manipulated. These functions work with the PIM kernel

## PIM Viewer

For viewing models creating using the PIM kernel, a web-based viewer has been created. This viewer converts the models into threejs, so that they can be visualised and manipulated in the web browser.
