# Overview

The Möbius Modeller is an open-source web platform for building modelling apps. Such apps allows users to create modelling procedures using visual programming techniques, combining flowcharts with drag-and-drop fill-in-the-blanks coding. The models can be published as interactive web pages, allowing visitors on the web to explore the models.

Apps can be built on top of the Möbius Modeller Platform, focusing on different use cases. To date, two apps have been developed: for geospatial modelling and for parametric modelling.

## Möbius Geospatial Modeller 

The Möbius Geospatial Modeller allows geocomputational procedures to be developed for creating interactive 3D geospatial datasets.

## Möbius Parametric Modeller

The Möbius Parametric Modeller allows  procedures to be developed for generating complex 3D models of buildings and urban neighbourhoods.

## Möbius Modeller Customization

The Möbius Modeller can be customised to different domains by developing specialized function libraries and specialized viewers. Contact us if you are interested in applying the Möbius Modeller in your domain.
