# Overview

The Möbius Modeller is a web application that allows users to create automated procedures using visual programming. All procedures are executed in the browser on the client side, and as such no server side process is required. These procedures could be applied in a wide variety of domains. (Contact us if you are interested in applying the Möbius Modeller in your domain.)

Currently, the focus is on Parametric Information Modelling (PIM) in the architectural and urban design domain, allowing procedures to be developed for generating and evaluating 3D models of buildings and urban neighbourhoods.
