## Möbius Modeller 1, ViziCities Example

Möbius Modeller 1 included the [ViziCities](http://ww.vizicities.com/) viewer, developed by Paul Waddell and his team at UC Berkeley. The image below shows the ViziCities viewer integrated into Möbius. The procedure shown on the right loops through the 2D building polygons and adds height information. ViziCities is then use to extrude and render the models.
